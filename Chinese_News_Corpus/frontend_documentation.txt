## Technical documentation for our frontend interface.

The front end includes a html, css and javascript file that interacts with each other
The html provides the interface layout and it includes 
A header: This displays a summary information of what the interface is about.

A search bar and dropdown menu: This includes a search bar where keywords can be typed and a dropdown indicating where the search should occur.

search button: This button 'on click' submits the result of the search to a function called "submit_search" in the Javascript file 

Buttons for polarities: This displays the polarity annotation for our corpus and they include (Positive, Negative and Neutral). 'On click' the button submits the id of the button to a function called "annotation" in the Javascript file.

Corpus statistics: These images are called and retrieved once the interface is loaded.


The Javascript file contains three functions as mentions above.
- The submit_search function that generates a query string for each search
- The annotation functions that generates query string for the each annotation respectively.
- The update_page function that allows the results of each search and click to be loaded in the same home page.

Note that each of the query string generated would be sent to the backend for processing.

The css file contains functions for the designs and aesthetics of our interface.
It contains the following:
- The background display, the color scheme and font size.
- The search button size, its position and color.
- All the polarity buttons, their size, shape, color and hover functionality.
